# Covid_19_Ireland_green_list

Look at the Covid 19 numbers from the ECDC website to see what countries Ireland could have an air bridge with.

I will use the ECDC website to download the current Covid 19 numbers.
Using this download, the csv file will be put into a pandas dataframe, looked at and trimmed down so that we have the data required to look at a rolling 14 day average of new cases.
